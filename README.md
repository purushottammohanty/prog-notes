Notes:   
The slides in the repository have been prepared using [xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) on [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html). xaringan is a RMarkdown extension based on the JavaScript library [remark.js](https://remarkjs.com) to generate HTML5 presentations. The `.html` files are then converted into `.pdf` using `pagedown::chrome_print()` function on R.
